issues:
  - There is a bug in the version of keepalived which ships with Ubuntu 14.04 which results in all
    backup nodes having the same priority. This causes the automatic failover to fail when more than
    two keepalived hosts are configured. To work around this issue it is recommended that deployers
    limit the number of keepalived hosts to no more than two, or that each host is configured with
    different priorities.
