issues:
  - Neutron currently does not support enabling the ``port_security``
    extension driver cleanly for existing networks. If networks are created
    and the plugin is enabled afterwards, VMs connected to those networks
    will not start. See bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1509312
upgrade:
  - When upgrading from Kilo to Liberty, the ``port_security`` extension
    driver will not be configured due to the known issues with enabling it
    after creating networks.
