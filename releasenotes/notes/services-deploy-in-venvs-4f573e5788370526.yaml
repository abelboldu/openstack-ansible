features:
  - Services deploy into virtual environments by default
    when the service relies on Python. Find the virtualenv
    for each service under ``/openstack/venvs/`` on the
    host or in the container where the service is
    deployed. Disable the use of virtualenv by overriding
    the service-specific variable (for example
    ``cinder_venv_enabled``) which defaults to ``True``.
issues:
  - Services deploy into virtual environments by default
    when the service relies on Python. On upgrade any
    Python packages installed on the host or container are
    not upgraded with the release unless the virtualenv
    for that service is disabled. There might be older and
    possibly broken packages left on the system outside of
    the virtualenv, which can cause confusion for those
    who attempt to use Python-based tools or services
    without using the virtualenv. These left over packages
    can be manually removed at the operator's discretion.
