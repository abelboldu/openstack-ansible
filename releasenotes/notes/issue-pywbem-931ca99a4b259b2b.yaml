    For OpenStack-Ansible Liberty versions <12.0.9 and Kilo
    versions <11.2.12 the package ``pywbem`` will fail to build
    due to the update to v0.8.0 including new requirements which
    are not met by the repo server. This issue has been resolved
    in 12.0.9. A workaround for this is to set ``pywbem<0.8.0``
    in the file ``global-requirement-pins.txt``.
