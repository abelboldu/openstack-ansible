    For OpenStack-Ansible Liberty versions >12.0.7,<12.0.9 the
    wheel version pinned in OpenStack-Ansible (0.29.0) is higher
    that the OpenStack upper-constraint (0.26.0). This causes an
    issue where the repo-server install may fail because it
    cannot find a version of wheel to install that meets the
    requirements of <0.26.0 and ==0.29.0. A workaround for this
    issue is to change the wheel package pin in the following files
    ``wheel==0.26.0``.

    * ``playbooks/inventory/group_vars/hosts.yml``
    * ``requirements.txt``
