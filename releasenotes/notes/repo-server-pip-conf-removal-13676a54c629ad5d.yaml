issues:
  - Depending on when the initial Kilo deployment was done it
    is possible the repository servers have a pip.conf locking
    down the environment which limits the packages available to
    to install. If this file is present it will cause build
    failures as the repository server attempts to build
    Liberty packages.
upgrade:
  - To fix this issue the ``pip.conf`` file needs to be removed
    from all repository servers. The upgrade playbook
    ``repo-server-pip-conf-removal.yml`` will remove the pip.conf
    file from the repository servers if it's found.
