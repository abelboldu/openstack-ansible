features:
  - MariaDB version 10.x is now the default in OpenStack-Ansible.
  - The percona-xtrabackup repository is now enabled in OpenStack-Ansible and
    it allows deployers to install and use
    `Percona's XtraBackup project <https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup>`_
    to perform online backups of data stored in MariaDB.
  - Deployers how have the option to set the the wsrep method via the
    ``galera_wsrep_sst_method``.
  - Deployers can specify the authentication credentials to be used with wsrep
    by configuring ``galera_wsrep_sst_auth_user`` and
    ``galera_wsrep_sst_auth_password``.
  - The Galera installation process has been optimized and takes less time
    to complete.
upgrade:
  - The max connections setting for Galera is now determined automatically
    by taking the number of vCPUs available and multiplying it by 100.
    Deployers may override this default via the ``galera_max_connections``
    variable.
  - The upstream MariaDB init script has replaced the custom init script that
    was provided by OpenStack-Ansible in previous versions.
  - The ``galera_upgrade`` variable is now provided to allow the MariaDB role
    to update existing installs.
